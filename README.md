ControlCharts Pattern Recognition: 
This repository contains a machine learning model trained on synthetic data to identify patterns from quantitative output of industrial process data, which could indicate an "out of control process".

Description: 
Control charts are used in industrial settings to monitor process variability and maintain control over processes. This project aims to use machine learning to automatically recognize patterns in control charts that may suggest an out of control process. The model is trained on synthetic data generated to represent various patterns commonly seen in control charts.
